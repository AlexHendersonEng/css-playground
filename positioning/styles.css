/*
    The position property specifies the type of positioning method 
    used for an element:
    - static: Default value. Elements render in order, as they 
              appear in the document flow
    - absolute: The element is positioned relative to its first 
                positioned (not static) ancestor element
    - fixed: The element is positioned relative to the browser window
    - relative: The element is positioned relative to its normal 
                position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's 
                LEFT position
    - sticky: The element is treated as relative until it crosses a 
              specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed
    - intial: Sets this property to its default value
    - inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element
